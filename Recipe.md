How to Make Paneer Tikka
The process is pretty simple, you marinate the paneer with spices and yogurt, let it sit for a bit so that the flavors mix well together and then arrange the paneer cubes along with onion and peppers in a skewer and grill.

However, the taste of paneer tikka lies in its marination of course.

So to make a good paneer tikka you first need to make a very good marinade.

My marinade includes lots of spices and Greek yogurt. Now if you can’t find Greek yogurt that’s okay. You may use regular yogurt too, just make sure to strain it for 3-4 hours before using.

You really need thick yogurt to marinate the panner cubes.
